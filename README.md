## A C++ Framework for Evolutionary Single-Objective Optimization Benchmarking

### Introduction
We introduce SEvoBench, a C++ framework for the benchmarking of evolutionary single-objective optimization.
The SEvoBench framework brings the following highlights:

+ Modular DE and PSO algorithms implemented at the software level using the Strategy and Builder design patterns, with additional evolutionary algorithms integrated.
+ The CEC2014 and CEC2017 benchmark suites are redesigned using the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP).
+ The CEC2010 large-scale benchmark suite is accelerated using SIMD technology.
+ Parallel testing is supported.
+ Implemented using C++20, following Modern C++ style.

### Future Work
SEvoBench is still under development, and some features and functionalities of it need improvement.
